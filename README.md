## Project Description

Narrator App is an application where a user inputs text and transcribed to speech. This application would help those with accessible needs for everyday and professional use. 

User Story
Hi, I'm Serena, a final-year medical student preparing for my exams and wrapping up my internship at the hospital nearby. I tend to have a lot on my plate but I want to stay inspired and motivated. I want an app that can help me stay motivated and positive throughout the day, especially during low moments.
